# Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets

In this work a conditional version of generative adversarial nets was implemented, which can be constructed by simply feeding the data, y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. This model can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels. Also the model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and provide preliminary examples of an application to image tagging and can generate descriptive tags which are not part of training labels.
