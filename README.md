# GANs

In this repository I implemented GANs and some of it's variants including Wassertein GANs, Deep Convoluted GANs, Conditional GANs and Conditional Image Synthesis with Auxiliary Classifier GANs, CycleGANs and Pix2Pix. Upon generating the images, I created gif files with a free online software - https://imgflip.com/. As a result imgflip.com shows at the bottom left of my gifs. My appreciation goes to all the researchers who originally published the papers.
